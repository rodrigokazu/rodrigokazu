I'm an independent researcher with more than ten years of experience in Python, C/C++ and MATLAB. I'm currently helping people walk again by modelling tactile responses applied to real-time feedback prosthetics! I also won the INSIGNEO Showcase prize for best research with this project in 2019. 

In my transition to the industry as a senior software engineer (technical lead) at the AMRC North West @ the University of Sheffield, I had two first-author conference abstracts accepted in the International MATADOR Conference on Advanced Manufacturing. 

Now I am on a new step in my career which is very aligned with the main skill I have acquired in my career. I am a data scientist for the very prestigious Integrated Manufacturing Group at the very vibrant Factory 2050 at the University of Sheffield. 


My skills include Python, C/C++, MATLAB, R, data mining, databases, predictive analysis, data analytics, and complex networks. All of that with the communication of actionable results and insights demonstrated by my various talks and papers, most of which are available online. 

My latest research output in computational neuroscience was presented at the Neuromatch conference: https://youtu.be/-MLN6EcUxG0
