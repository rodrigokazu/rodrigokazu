I am a researcher in computational neuroscience with experience in complex networks, comparative neuroanatomy and cell culturing. In the Active Touch Lab, I helped people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! In addition to that, I am a member of INSIGNEO. My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience and information processing in the somatosensory cortex. Additionally, I am trying to change the way we understand brain development by developing a computational model of neuronal network generation based on brain evolution and complex network analysis.

I also won the INSIGNEO Showcase prize for best research with this study in 2019 and the breakthrough was recently published in the journal iScience! An achievement that was also featured in various news articles such as these:

The code for our model that simulates the neural afferents of the foot sole is available here:

Now I am at an exciting step in my career: I am a data scientist for the prestigious Integrated Manufacturing Group at the vibrant Factory 2050 at the University of Sheffield. Here I am leading a project that will shape the next generation of data scientists called NextGen and that showcases the capabilities of our data cloud:

I am also a part of several projects that include data analytics, technical delivery and client engagement for data-driven projects in manufacturing. My computational skills include Python, C/C++, MATLAB, R, predictive analysis, data analytics, and complex networks. 

My latest research output in computational neuroscience was presented at the Neuromatch conference:
