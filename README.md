I am a research associate in computational neuroscience with experience in complex networks, comparative neuroanatomy and cell culturing. In the Active Touch Lab, I am helping people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! In addition to that, I am a member of INSIGNEO and a data scientist for the AMRC at the University of Sheffield. My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience and information processing in the somatosensory cortex.

I also won the INSIGNEO Showcase prize for best research with this study in 2019 and the breakthrough was recently published in the journal iScience!

The code for our model that simulates the neural afferents of the foot sole is available in this public repository:

Now I am at a step in my career which is particularly aligned with the primary skill I have acquired over the years: I am a data scientist for the prestigious Integrated Manufacturing Group at the vibrant Factory 2050 at the University of Sheffield. Here I am leading a project that will shape the next generation of data scientists called NextGen and that showcases the capabilities of our data cloud:

My primary computational skills include Python, C/C++, MATLAB, R, data mining, predictive analysis, data analytics, and complex networks. All of that with the communication of actionable results demonstrated by my various talks and papers, most of which are available online. 

My latest research output in computational neuroscience was presented at the Neuromatch conference:
