I'm an independent researcher with more than ten years of experience in Python, C/C++ and MATLAB. I'm currently helping people walk again by modelling tactile responses applied to real-time feedback prosthetics! I also won the INSIGNEO Showcase prize for best research with this project in 2019. My current role as a technical lead at the AMRC North West @ the University of Sheffield is aimed at help businesses in the Lancashire area achieve better results with the aid of cutting edge research in data analytics and AI. My skills include programming in Python, C/C++, MATLAB and R, data mining, databases, predictive analysis, data analytics, complex networks and the communication of actionable results and insights as demonstrated by my various talks and papers, most of which are available online.

The AMRC @ the University of Sheffield is a network of world-leading research and innovation centres working with advanced manufacturing companies of any size. We specialise in carrying out world-leading research into advanced machining, manufacturing and materials, which is of practical use to industry. We help high-profile commercial partners such as BAE Systems, McLaren, Siemens, Rolls-Royce, Sheffield Forgemasters, Sellafield Ltd, Westinghouse and Areva.
