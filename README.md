I have a PhD in Cybernetics and am currently focused on computational neuroscience and complex networks at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge Neuroscience (University of Cambridge). Previously, I helped people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! 

I also won the INSIGNEO Showcase prize for best research with this study in 2019 and the breakthrough was recently published in the journal iScience!

The code for our model that simulates the neural afferents of the foot sole is available here:

My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience, brain development and brain evolution. Additionally, I am trying to understand cell fates in Glioblastoma Multiforme.

My latest research output in computational neuroscience was presented at the Neuromatch conference:
